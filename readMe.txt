To execute: node app.js

Additional Notes: - User cannot block or message him/herself (helped testing and most realistic)
                  - Sometimes when you click ctrl it will register it as "stuck" and continue to unblock/block the user when double clicked.
                    Click ctrl again and it will be fixed.
